# **Reporting Security Issues**

The project's team and community take security issues.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, go to the project's issues and create a new issue using the `⚠️ Security Report` issue template.

Read carefully the instructions of this issue template, and if your report could leak data or might expose
how to gain access to a restricted area or break the system,
please email me using the email address link available on my profile https://github.com/vanhoofmaarten and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We'll endeavor to respond quickly, and will keep you updated throughout the process.
